## **Project Overview**
<!-- importance -->

#### 🚀 Client kickoff 
Learning environments are always accompanied by tools. From the [cartesian system](https://wild.maths.org/rené-descartes-and-fly-ceiling) to [diagrams](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41235-016-0031-6), various tools have historically afforded various learning processes. 
Quizlet is undoubtedly one the largest platforms for student online learning. Over 60 million active learners from 130 countries practice and master more than 500 million study sets of content on every subject and topic.  

<!--example:Healthcare is an inevitable service for millions of people — athenahealth works to make it a better experience. Since families, health needs, and resources vary from person to person: “navigating healthcare” may look vastly different because multiple factors affecting their experience.-->

#### 🔎 The problem
<!--Explore the healthcare experience for young adults and the individuals who are still involved in managing it

Understand the pain points for all parties involved and search for underlying patterns 

Ideate how athenahealth can improve the experience to set young adults and their families up for success -->
My collaboraters and I were motivated to:
- Explore the frequent feature uses and experience of Quizlet users.
- Evaluate three main tasks described from the frequent feature uses.
- Ideate on how Quizlet can improve student's learning outcomes.
