## Project Overview
<!-- importance -->

#### 🚀 Client kickoff 
Learning environments are always accompanied by tools. From the [cartesian system](https://wild.maths.org/rené-descartes-and-fly-ceiling) to [diagrams](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41235-016-0031-6), various tools have historically afforded various learning processes. 
Quizlet is undoubtedly one the largest platforms for student online learning. Over 60 million active learners from 130 countries practice and master more than 500 million study sets of content on every subject and topic.  

<!--example:Healthcare is an inevitable service for millions of people — athenahealth works to make it a better experience. Since families, health needs, and resources vary from person to person: “navigating healthcare” may look vastly different because multiple factors affecting their experience.-->

### 🔎 The problem
<!--Explore the healthcare experience for young adults and the individuals who are still involved in managing it

Understand the pain points for all parties involved and search for underlying patterns 

Ideate how athenahealth can improve the experience to set young adults and their families up for success -->
My collaboraters and I were motivated to:
- Explore the frequent feature uses and experience of Quizlet users.
- Evaluate three main tasks described from the frequent feature uses.
- Ideate on how Quizlet can improve student's learning outcomes.

<!--### The challenge: research questions
<!--6. The challenge (What specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points that the project solves. Were there any technical constraints or business KPIs you had to keep in mind? Who are you users and what are their specific needs)-->
### Method and tools
<!--7. Solution (What method/process were used to solve specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points? How did features address the objectives?)--> 
#### User Requirements Interview {#user-req-int}
Participants
: In order to understand the frequent feature uses and experience of experienced Quizlet users, 9 individuals were interviewed. While most participants were juniors in university, 20% were transfer and 20% were graduate students, demonstrating a usage of Quizlet’s interface across academic levels. Their self-reported expertise level ranged from 1 to 10, where the group average was <b>8.11</b>. Given the limitations of recruiting for this project, none of the participants were in high school, thus the descriptions and conclusions can only be attributed to the representation of the participants. 


The interview was composed of the following sections: 
: 

1. <b>On-boarding questions</b> where we introduced ourselfes and gave an overview of the project. We also asked participants to introduce themselves and to indicate whether they are a student, whether they work, and more.
2. <b>Utility-based inquiry</b> where we asked participants to describe their use with quizlet. This included questions like <i>"what is the last time you used Quizlet?"</i>
3. <b>Subjective-based inquiry</b> where we asked participants about their preferences and attitudes towards quizlet. This included questions like <i>"what are some frustrations you have while using Quizlet?"</i>
4. <b>Demonstration-based inquiry</b> where we asked participants to demonstrate how they would use a Quizlet to accomplish a specific task or goal. This included asking participants to spend a few minutes exploring quizlet and showing us their flashcard sets that they have.


#### 📊 Results: User Requirements Interview

Here are the results! 

#### User Experience Questionnaires
Participants:
: Participants were the same from the User Requirements Interview.  

Interview:
: Participants were asked to rate on a scale of 1 - 7 how much the give word fits as a descriptive word for Quizlet.

#### User Evaluation Tasks
Participants
: 


Task 1
: Participants were asked to create a set of flashcards from a provided excel spreadsheet by importing the excel spreadsheet to a new set


Task 2 
: A highly frequent use of Quizlet found from the user requirements interview was to use quizlet as a search engine to answerquiz and homework questions.  Thus, in task 2 we gave participants a question and asked them answer it using quizlet. The question was predetermined as answerable on quizlet. The question was presented to participants on an index card, and then the participants will be asked to read aloud the question so that they understand it.

Task 3
: Participants were told to imagine that they were enrolled in a specific class at a specific university. Participants were asked to search for the a class flashcard set and make a copy of this set and to customize it for later usage.
