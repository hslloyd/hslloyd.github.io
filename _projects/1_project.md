## **Project Overview**
<!-- importance -->

#### üöÄ Client kickoff 
Learning environments are always accompanied by tools. From the [cartesian system](https://wild.maths.org/ren√©-descartes-and-fly-ceiling) to [diagrams](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41235-016-0031-6), various tools have historically afforded various learning processes. 
Quizlet is undoubtedly one the largest platforms for student online learning. Over 60 million active learners from 130 countries practice and master more than 500 million study sets of content on every subject and topic. ¬†

<!--example:Healthcare is an inevitable service for millions of people ‚Äî athenahealth works to make it a better experience. Since families, health needs, and resources vary from person to person: ‚Äúnavigating healthcare‚Äù may look vastly different because multiple factors affecting their experience.-->

#### üîé The problem
<!--Explore the healthcare experience for young adults and the individuals who are still involved in managing it

Understand the pain points for all parties involved and search for underlying patterns 

Ideate how athenahealth can improve the experience to set young adults and their families up for success -->
My collaboraters and I were motivated to:
- Explore the frequent feature uses and experience of Quizlet users.
- Evaluate three main tasks described from the frequent feature uses.
- Ideate on how Quizlet can improve student's learning outcomes.

##### User Requirements Interview {#user-req-int}
Participants
: In order to understand the frequent feature uses and experience of experienced Quizlet users, 9 individuals were interviewed. While most participants were juniors in university, 20% were transfer and 20% were graduate students, demonstrating a usage of Quizlet‚Äôs interface across academic levels. 
Their self-reported expertise on a scale of 1 to 10 averaged around **8.11**. Even though high-school users are a large portion of Quizlet's user population, the recruitment limitations for this project resulted in a convenient sample. Thus, all the descriptions and conclusions can only be attributed to the representation of the participants. 


The interview sections: 
: 

1. **On-boarding questions** where we introduced ourselfes and gave an overview of the project. We also asked participants to introduce themselves and to indicate whether they are a student, whether they work, and more.
2. **Utility-based inquiry** where we asked participants to describe their use with quizlet. This included questions like <i>"what is the last time you used Quizlet?"</i>
3. **Subjective-based inquiry** where we asked participants about their preferences and attitudes towards Quizlet. This included questions like <i>"what are some frustrations you have while using Quizlet?"</i>
4. **Demonstration-based inquiry** where we asked participants to demonstrate how they would use a Quizlet to accomplish a specific task or goal. This included asking participants to spend a few minutes exploring Quizlet and showing us their flashcard sets that they have.


üìä User Requirements Interview Results
: 
- Most of the participants reported that they had never made a flashcard set themselves, even though they use Quizlet often.
- Participants often expressed that they would use Quizlet on public transit, in time between work and class, or while eating a meal. 
- A frequent use was to use Quizlet as a search engine for answering online quizzes or homework.  Users of Quizlet will often upload the questions often generated by the textbook offered to instructors in their flashcard sets. Thus, when instructors post online quizzes or homework assignments based on the textbook material, students who copy-and-paste the question into google, are brought to a Quizlet set. 

##### Usability Testing {#user-tasks}

Participants
:  A total of 10 participants were recruited for the usability testing. While most participants 90% were undergraduate students and 10% were graduate students. Their self-reported expertise on a scale of 1 to 10 averaged around **7.05**. Given the limitations of recruiting for this project, none of the participants were in high school, thus the descriptions and conclusions can only be attributed to the representation of the participants. 

Tasks
:  
**Task 1:** Participants were asked to create a set of flashcards from a provided excel spreadsheet by importing the excel spreadsheet to a new set


**Task 2:** A highly frequent use of Quizlet found from the user requirements interview was to use Quizlet as a search engine to answerquiz and homework questions.  Thus, in task 2 we gave participants a question and asked them answer it using Quizlet. The question was predetermined as answerable on Quizlet. The question was presented to participants on an index card, and then the participants will be asked to read aloud the question so that they understand it.

**Task 3:** Participants were told to imagine that they were enrolled in a specific class at a specific university. Participants were asked to search for the a class flashcard set and make a copy of this set and to customize it for later usage.

üìä Usability Testing Results
: 
<!--8. Results (Project success metrics, awards, reflections, project next steps and/or lessons learnt)--> 
- Participants consistently struggled with task 1, demonstrating a weakness in the accurate connection between the user‚Äôs mental model of the interface‚Äôs metaphorical use of the term ‚Äúimport‚Äù and the system‚Äôs conceptual model. The metaphor in this feature is presented as a way to import in analogous with the physical action of importing goods (food, materials, etc. through ships, trains, planes); a form of bringing resources from another system to the current one. Participant‚Äôs mental model was evidently similar to many systems that utilize the term ‚Äúimport,‚Äù meaning bringing an entire file from one system to the current. Quizlet doesn‚Äôt accurately depict that interface metaphor since this feature doesn‚Äôt evidently offer that function, deceiving the users until they realize the mechanism required to copy-and-paste the information over.  
-  After completing task 2, none of the participants were entirely confident with their understanding of the concept of interest (gestalt grouping principles). Since this task was implemented to understand the frequented use of Quizlet as a search engine for questions, many participants seemed overwhelmed by how information was being presented to them. Ultimately many of them were demonstrating a level of fatigue from an overload of information. Participants consistently suggested they always looked for simpler sets of information, relative to the superfluous study sets offered to them. This is an issue of the mission of Quizlet versus the user experience of the system: Quizlet‚Äôs search engine ultimately matched the user with the title of the set-in regard to what string they searched. The presented search engine results depict that Quizlet prioritizes the user finding sets, rather than information. This then leads an interface weakness of mapping between the system and the real world. User‚Äôs expected to be able to use the search engine to get a layout familiar to them of information, but they were provided with flashcard sets that were difficult to used. In the real world, when looking for an answer to information, people default to mediums with a layout of text (i.e. textbooks, dictionaries, etc.), users don‚Äôt often look through flash cards to find an answer. In support of this flaw in mapping between system and the real world, participant Z stated he expected to find information from the class, not the sets, since the class feature matches his mental model of class, ‚Äúwhere people learn new information.‚Äù Participant Z, and others, were surprised after struggling to find the information buried in a set. All of the users expected to find the information and have to weave through sets to get there. 
- In task 3, participants were generally successful in finding the course of interest, indicating that the user‚Äôs expectation of finding a course was met. The system generally offered leeway for exploration of customizing a set, and most of the participants were able to do so in this manner. While it took a bit of time for users to complete this task, in observations this task seemed to be overall the most errorless.

    The average rate of task completion for task 1 was 7:08 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.14 seconds. The average rate of this task was around 3:11 minutes with a standard deviation of about 0.11 seconds. The average rate of task completion was 6:04 minutes with a standard deviation of about 0.12 seconds (See Figure 1). Additionally, 16% of the variance in average rate of task completion can be explained by the variance in the self-reported expertise level of Quizlet (R2 = 0.165, see Figure 2). In consideration of a sample size of 10, this indicates an interface that has an ease of learnability. Even though statistcs are presented, interpretations of these results should take into account that the sample size in underpowered.

üìä User Experience Questionnaires Results
: 
<!--8. Results (Project success metrics, awards, reflections, project next steps and/or lessons learnt)-->
 After all participants completed each task, they reported on a scale of 1-to-7, an average positive valanced word rating of 5.44 with a standard deviation of 0.37. Indicating a lot of positive valanced words like fast, organized, and expected were strongly fitting to the interface. On the same scale, they rated negative valanced words as not being fit around 2.7 with a standard deviation of 0.49. This is in congruency with the indication that a lot of negative valanced words like complex, annoying, inconsistent as not fitting well to the interface (See Table 3 and Appendix D for more information on this User Experience Questionnaire). After everyone completed the tasks, some common words to describe Quizlet was ‚Äúhelpful, massive, content, and confused.‚Äù
