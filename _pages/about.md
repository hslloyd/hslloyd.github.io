Hi there! I am a researcher in the [Cognitive Tools Lab](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/) and the [Pedagogy and Science of Instruction Lab](https://pilegard.ucsd.edu/) where I lead research projects exploring how cognitive tools, ranging from data visualizations to generative AI tutors, can enhance student learning outcomes beyond traditional standards like rote memorization. While technological evolution is often considered a constant disruptor in education, I view these advances as the driving force behind our educational system. My research aims to understand how these tools facilitate the development and utilization of <b>quantitative reasoning skills</b>, a critical learning outcome in today's complex society.


I am equipped with a diverse skill set encompassing mixed methods research, data science, and science communication. I've honed this skill set during my six years of managing social science and nonprofit educational programs to deliver data-driven insights for improving learning outcomes.
