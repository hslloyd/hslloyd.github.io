Hi there! I am a graduate student in [Experimental Psychology](https://psychology.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego. As a member of the [Cognitive Tools Lab](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/) and the [Pedagogy and Science of Instruction Lab](https://pilegard.ucsd.edu/), my research investigates how humans develop and learn to reason with quantitative data. I leverage my diverse skill set that includes mixed methods research, data science, and science communication to provide data-driven insights into human behavior.

Outside of my research, I enjoy doing the daily mini crossword, [running in the redwoods](https://www.strava.com/athletes/78020017), and wheel-throwing.
